# Regimen
  Regimen is a mobile app designed to allow users to create workout routines and view a detailed list of exercises. When the user first logs in they will be directed to the My Workouts view where the user is able to create a new routine or view ones that have already been created. When the user selects a routine to view they will then be able to add days to that routine, and exercises to those days.
  When the user selects to view the list of exercises, they will be taken to a page of exercises ordered by category. The user can select their preferred category and view the relevent exercises. When the use finds an exercise they would like to know more about, they can select that exercise and they will be directed to a details view for the respective exercise.
